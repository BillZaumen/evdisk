evdisk (1.10) unstable; urgency=low
 * Fixed a bug in which the gpg key ring could not be found due to running
   as root (needed while creating the file system). Also added options to
   set the GPG home directory, if desired, and added a verbose mode (-v
   option) to show more of the output from programs the evdisk runs.

evdisk (1.8) unstable; urgency=low
  * The gpg -K option was replaced by gpg -K --with-colons
    The change was made because the "--with-colons" option is supposed
    to provide a stable syntax suitable for use in scripts as it is
    easily parsed. Also, a configuration file was added so that the
    dialog box brought up by "evdisk --create" will show additional
    GPG user IDS, and so that one can preselect GPG user IDs.

evdisk (1.7) unstable; urgency=low
  * Messages and control labels/names, etc., where moved to the file
    EVDisk.properties.  This will enable localization based on any
    supported locale, each of which will need its own properties files
    as described in the JDK documentation.

evdisk (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The software is now kept in a JAR file instead of being run
    as a #! script (which the latest versions of Java allow the
    java interpretter to do).
