EVDisk is a simple utility for creating and mounting a LUKS file
system.  The file system is stored in an ordinary
file named 'encrypted' that will be mounted using a loopback device.
Meanwhile the LUKS key, which is automatically generated, is
stored in a file named key.gpg which (naturally) is encrypted using
GPG. The file system will be mounted on a directory named 'root'.
The two ordinary files and the root directory are all members of
the same directory.  Normally other files will not be put in this
directory.  EVDisk can be run from the command line or started
by a desktop action.  After starting, a GUI will prompt for
GPG passphrases and one's login password (sudo is needed) as
required.  A window will appear that will allow one to unmount
the file system by 'closing' it.

The intended use case is for backups.  One can use EVDisk to set up
a flash drive, and then use EVDisk to mount the encrypted file
system, closing it after the backups are complete. If the backup disk
is lost or stolen, trying to decrypt it would require either breaking
GPG encryption or guessing a 32-character randomly generated LUKS key,
and the key ring needed to decrypt the LUKS key is not on the backup
disk.

-------- Compilation ------------

To compile and build a Debian package, just type the command

   make

This command will use the following programs: javac, jar, cp, sed,
install, rm, inkscape, gzip, chmod, mkdir, dpkg-deb, and fakeroot.
The program inkscape is run as a command-line program to create
a series of PNG files containing icons of various sizes.

Every time a new version is created, the file Makefile should be
updated to set the new VERSION variable and a new entry should be
added to changelog. In addition, changelog.Debian should be
updated.

--------- Files -----------

The Git repository for EVDisk contains several files:

  * changelog contains a log describing changes from one version
    to the next

  * changelog.Debian really just points to changelog and is there
    because Debian installations expect it.

  * control is the Debian control file.

  * copyright is the standard copyright notice and contains licensing
    information (GPLv3, or later)

  * evdisk is a shell script that will start EVDisk from the command
    line for testing

  * evdisk.1 is the man page for the evdisk command

  * evdisk.conf.5 is the man page for the EVDisk configuration file
    evdisk.conf (this file is optional and it is up to the user to
    create it if desired).

  * evdisk.desktop is the Gnome desktop file

  * EVDisk.java contains the source code.

  * EVDisk.properties is used for internationalization and localization.
    It represents a resource bundle. Additional ones are needed for
    localization for languages other than English.

  * evdisk.sh contains the shell script that will be installed in /usr/bin.

  * evdisk.svg contains the EVDisk icon

  * Makefile contains the file used by the 'make' command to build a package.

  * postinst is a script needed by Debian packages during package
    installation (it causes the icon cache to be updated).

  * postrm is a script needed by Debian packages during package
    removal (it causes the icon cache to be updated).

The repository structure is flat - all the files are in the same
directory - because there are only a handful of files for the whole
project.

--------------- TO DO ------------

The main things missing are resource-bundle property files for
localization.  While there is a default for English, ones for
other languages are missing.  The default property file EVDisk.properties
contains comments describing each property and how it is used in
addition to the English text for that property.
